# Data Analysis Project 02

This project will give you a chance to go through the process of analyzing a complex database on your own in order to discover newsworthy information.

Unlike the first data analysis project, where you reverse engineered an existing story, your goal is to find something newsworthy that others have not already reported in a novel data set that could be used as a foundation for future reporting.

## Group project

You will be assigned to work as part of a group for this project.  As a group, you will all work with the same data set, and turn in the same final work product.

It is critical that everyone expend equal amount of effort on this project.  

If I learn during the course of this project that a member of a group isn't pulling their weight, I reserve the right to remove that person from the group and assign them an individual project.

The groups I've assigned are here. Note these are different than the last group. [link](https://umd.instructure.com/courses/1288268/groups#tab-75451)

## The data

As a group, you should pick one topic on which to focus, and a corresponding principal data set.  The topics are:

* Police shootings, using the Washington Post's data set "Fatal Force". [Interactive database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/). [GitHub repo for story with data](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-homicides).
* NYPD police officer complaints, using ProPublica's "NYPD Files". [Interactive Database](https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/). [Data download](https://www.propublica.org/datastore/dataset/civilian-complaints-against-new-york-city-police-officers)
* Tracking symbols the Confederacy.  The Southern Poverty Law Center has for years gathered data on "public symbols of the Confederacy" -- monuments, official place names, schools, roads, et cetera.  It has also been tracking removal or changes of those symbols. [Information about the "Whose Heritage project"](https://www.splcenter.org/20190201/whose-heritage-public-symbols-confederacy) [Data in Google sheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1W4H2qa2THM1ni53QYZftGob_k_Bf9HreFAtCERfjCIU/edit?pli=1#gid=1205021846)
* The warming climate in the United States, using data from the Washington Posts's "2 degrees Celsius: Beyond the Limit." [Data download](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-2C-beyond-the-limit-usa/). [Description](https://www.washingtonpost.com/climate-environment/2020/08/07/how-use-posts-climate-data-analysis/)
* If your group has an idea for another data set you'd like to use, I'd be happy to consider it.  Please reach out to me this week to discuss.

In addition to using the main data set I've provided, you will be expected to identify at least one additional data set -- either a simple one or complex -- to incorporate into your analysis.

## How to approach

You are a reporter for a national news organization. You are interested in doing an original analysis to identify some describe broad trend or pattern, based on a hypothesis founded on reporting and research you have done.  Your task is to find something someone else hasn't already reported.  

It's possible your original hypothesis will not stand up to your first cut at analysis. A lack of a result may be newsworthy, but you should also be prepared to pivot.    

You should find experts familiar with your topic to help put your findings in context. You should also, through your analysis, identify geographic locations that exemplify the trends you've uncovered where you may be able to identify characters to bring a story to life.    

You should develop a motivating question or working hypothesis to test with your analysis.  These questions should be developed by doing research, reading news stories and/or discussions with experts.  

## Deliverables, deadlines, grades

The project is worth 25 percent of your total final grade.

* Deliverable 1 (week 11) - 5 percent
  * Milestone 1: as a joint forum post of 200-300 words, indicate which topic your group wishes to focus on. Provide three to four motivating questions you could use to begin to interrogate your data set.  For example:
      * Using the climate data, "which parts of the country have seen faster rates of warming over the last century?" or "Have counties that are deeply relying on farming warmed faster than other parts of the country?"
      * Using the fatal police shooting data, "have shootings where the victim had mental illness increased in recent years?"

* Deliverable 2 (week 12) - 10 percent
  * Turn in, via GitHub, a draft of the data notebook showing your effort to answer those questions, or new questions that arise in the course of analysis.
  * It's fine if your notebook is messy at this point, but I should be able to get a sense of what work you've done. Use a combination of code, comments and text to explain your work.

* Deliverable 3 (week 14) - 15 percent
  * Turn in, via GitHub, the latest draft of the data notebook.
  * It's fine if your notebook is messy at this point, but I should be able to get a sense of what work you've done. Use a combination of code, comments and text to explain your work.  

* Deliverable 4 (week 15) - 60 percent
  * Turn in a final story memo, described below.
  * Turn in, via GitHub, a final data notebook that contains the code to load, clean, analyze and reproduce any findings cited in your story.  Your final notebook should contain ONLY the code needed to support those findings.  

* Peer review and teamwork - 10 percent
  * Your teammates will be asked to anonymously review your level of effort and contribution to the project. No one will see these reviews but me. I will use these reviews, in concert with my own observations, as a guide in determining this portion of your grade. This is designed to make sure everyone on the team pulls their weight.   

## Final story Memo

This story memo should pitch a story idea derived primarily from your analysis of the data, including a discussion of what you found that was newsworthy when you analyzed the data, how the data could be used to develop the story, and what additional steps would be needed to complete the reporting of this story.

The story memo should be written as if you were trying to get the attention of a very busy editor and convince that editor to give you the opportunity to pursue a story you believe is suggested by your analysis.

The final story memo should include the following:

* A strong statement at the top. Write this as if I am your editor and you are competing for my attention with reporters pitching other story ideas. That is, don’t start by saying, “I sat down and launched R and looked at the database and sorted it 10 different ways.” Tell me right up front what you found that was interesting or what you found that suggests a dynamite story. Tell me how your most newsworthy findings relate to what you found in your research about prior uses of similar data for stories elsewhere. Do not pitch your findings for more than they are worth, however, or make assertions not supported by your work.
* A summary of the results of your analysis. Describe results that are germane to the main thrust of the story you are pitching and, if appropriate, relevant results that suggest other interesting avenues to explore. Indicate whether your findings are new or whether they present a local angle for similar findings reported elsewhere.
* Pros and cons of the data. Discuss both the strengths and limitations of the data.
* How you would verify your findings. Identify the specific reporting and data steps would you take and the types of information you would use to determine whether the results of your analysis are accurate and significant. If your analysis suggests fault or issues of accountability on the part of public or private figures, indicate whom you would need to contact for response to ensure that your reporting was fair and accurate.
* Bringing it home. Indicate the specific steps you would need to take to finish reporting the story. Include the people you would contact and, if relevant, the places you would visit. Indicate how you would make the story real to readers.
* Editors are not interested in process. Don’t fill the memo with what steps you took.
