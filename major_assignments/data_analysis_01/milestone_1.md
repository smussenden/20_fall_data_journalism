# Data Analysis Project 01
## Milestone 1

For each group, I've listed the paragraphs you need to incorporate into your data analysis.  You should use data analysis to reproduce these findings.

## Group 1

  * [Fewer inspectors, more deaths: The Trump administration rolls back workplace safety inspections](https://publicintegrity.org/politics/system-failure/deaths-cutbacks-workplace-safety-inspections-osha/)
  * [GitHub repo with code and data](https://github.com/PublicI/osha-fatality-inspections)

1. Knowles’ accident was one of 3,203 that led to a death or “catastrophe” — defined by the U.S. Department of Labor as hospitalizations of three or more workers — and triggered an investigation by safety inspectors at the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration during the first three and a half years of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to the agency’s enforcement data.

2. In 2019, OSHA’s safety inspectors conducted 962 investigations into fatal or catastrophic workplace incidents — the highest number since the agency began publishing the data in 2011.

3. The agency has conducted slightly fewer safety inspections during the first three years of Trump’s presidency than during a comparable period at the end of President Barack Obama’s second term, even though the labor force grew by 16 percent, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of the agency’s inspection data.

4. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA has been cutting back even more, conducting only 5,127 inspections since March 13, when Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency. That’s a drop of about two-thirds compared to the same period last year.

  * [As police struggle to solve homicides, Baltimore residents see an ‘open season for killing’](https://www.washingtonpost.com/investigations/as-police-struggle-to-solve-homicides-baltimore-residents-see-an-open-season-for-killing/2018/12/26/7ee561e4-fb24-11e8-8c9a-860ce2a8148f_story.html)

  * [Interactive database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2018/investigations/unsolved-homicide-database/)

1. As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted. City police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014; last year (2018), the rate was just 27 percent, a 14 percentage point drop.

2. Of 50 of the nation’s largest cities, Baltimore is one of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis. In Chicago, the homicide arrest rate has dropped 21 percentage points, in Boston it has dropped 12 points and in St. Louis it is down 9.

3. Baltimore is also one of 30 cities that have seen an increase in homicides in recent years, with the greatest raw number increase in killings of any city other than Chicago, which has four times the population. While homicide rates remain near historical lows in most American cities, Baltimore and Chicago are now both seeing murder tallies that rival the early 2000s.

4.  While there is evidence for and against a nationwide Ferguson effect — the theory that crime increased after 2014 as police faced more scrutiny following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. — in Baltimore there is an indisputable Freddie Gray effect. As violence in the city has risen since 2015, the likelihood of a killer being arrested has dropped precipitously.



## Group 3

* Group_03
  * [Nearly 250 women have been fatally shot by police since 2015](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/2020/investigations/police-shootings-women/)
  * [GitHub repo with data](https://github.com/washingtonpost/data-police-shootings)
  * [Interactive database](https://www.washingtonpost.com/graphics/investigations/police-shootings-database/)

1. “Since The Washington Post began tracking fatal shootings by police in 2015, officers have fatally shot 247 women out of the more than 5,600 people killed overall.”

2. “Since 2015, Black women have accounted for less than 1 percent of the overall fatal shootings in cases where race was known. But within this small subset, Black women, who are 13 percent of the female population, account for 20 percent of the women shot and killed and 28 percent of the unarmed deaths.”

3. “The starkest difference between women and men is the rate: Women account for about half the population, but 4 percent of the killings.”

4. “Crenshaw said Black women’s deaths also may be dismissed as “collateral damage” if they are killed while police are pursuing someone else. Twenty of the 247 women were killed in that kind of situation, analysis shows. In 12 of those 20 shootings, police said the women killed were caught in crossfire or shot accidentally.”



## Group 4

  * [Over a Dozen Black and Latino Men Accused a Cop of Humiliating, Invasive Strip Searches. The NYPD Kept Promoting Him.](https://www.propublica.org/article/over-a-dozen-black-and-latino-men-accused-a-cop-of-humiliating-invasive-strip-searches-the-nypd-kept-promoting-him)
  * [Download data from ProPublica](https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/)
  * [Interactive Database](https://projects.propublica.org/nypd-ccrb/)

1. The allegations against McCormack read in some ways like those against many other cops in the NYPD: that he was destructive in searching a home or overly physical with someone on the street. What stands out, though, is how often Black and Latino men accused him of invasive, humiliating searches.

2. Of at least 77 allegations made against him [McCormack] in 26 separate CCRB complaints, 29 were unsubstantiated; five were “unfounded,” meaning investigators concluded the incident never took place; and 27 were “exonerated,” meaning the conduct fell within patrol guidelines.

3. Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.

4. The story focused on Christopher McCormack. Use data analysis to justify that decision.  Why does he stand out as newsworthy, from all of the people they could have selected?

## Group 5


* Group_05
  * [Out of control: 17 years. 179 victims. The deadly toll of street racing in Los Angeles](https://www.latimes.com/projects/la-me-street-racing/)
  * [GitHub repo with data and code](https://github.com/datadesk/street-racing-analysis)

1. [Valentina D’Alessandro] was one of at least 179 people who have died in Los Angeles County since 2000 in accidents where street racing was suspected, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of coroner’s records, police reports and media accounts from 2000 to 2017.

2. The deadliest year on record was 2007, with 18 fatal crashes. After a period with relatively few recorded deaths, the count grew in recent years, with 15 fatalities in 2015, 11 in 2016 and 12 deaths in 2017, the Times analysis shows.

3. The dead were overwhelmingly male and young: More than half were 21 or younger, including two children, ages 4 and 8, killed along with their mother. Slightly less than half of the victims— 47% — were behind the wheel. The rest were either passengers in the speeding vehicles, spectators or people simply walking on a sidewalk or driving home.

4. Deaths have occurred all across L.A. County, with the biggest concentration in the small city of Commerce. Eleven have died on the small, industrial city’s streets since 2000.
