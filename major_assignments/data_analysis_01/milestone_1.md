# Data Analysis Project 01
## Milestone 1

In a short forum post, identify the five most important paragraphs from the story that appear to have resulted directly from original data analysis by the reporters. Detail why you chose those paragraphs, in terms of their centrality to the story and what made you think they were created through data analysis.

You should also indicate if any characters, organizations or locations highlighted in the story appear to have been chosen as a result of data analysis.

The forum post should be about 300 words, excluding the sentences from the story in the word count.

The post you write should be done as a group, but each person needs to post it separately. From this, your group and I will settle on between one and three findings to reproduce.

Knowles’ accident was one of 3,203 that led to a death or “catastrophe” — defined by the U.S. Department of Labor as hospitalizations of three or more workers — and triggered an investigation by safety inspectors at the U.S. Occupational Safety and Health Administration during the first three and a half years of Donald Trump’s presidency, according to the agency’s enforcement data. In 2019, OSHA’s safety inspectors conducted 962 investigations into fatal or catastrophic workplace incidents — the highest number since the agency began publishing the data in 2011.

The agency has conducted slightly fewer safety inspections during the first three years of Trump’s presidency than during a comparable period at the end of President Barack Obama’s second term, even though the labor force grew by 16 percent, according to a Center for Public Integrity analysis of the agency’s inspection data. Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA has been cutting back even more, conducting only 5,127 inspections since March 13, when Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency. That’s a drop of about two-thirds compared to the same period last year.



1. “Amid the COVID-19 pandemic, OSHA has been cutting back even more, conducting only 5,127 inspections since March 13, when Trump declared the coronavirus a national emergency. That’s a drop of about two-thirds compared to the same period last year.”

I chose this paragraph because it outlines the issue addressed by the article: a decrease in inspections conducted by OSHA. The decrease in the number of inspections is proving harmful and leading to “catastrophic” and “fatal” incidents such as the death of workers like Shawn Knowles. In terms of data analysis, the reporter obtained inspection reports and compared the number of inspections conducted in March 2020 to March 2019.

2. “Since January 2013, OSHA has conducted more than 6,800 investigations into workplaces that had a fatal or catastrophic incident. The vast majority of them — about 91 percent — had not been inspected in the previous 10 years, according to a Public Integrity analysis of the agency’s enforcement data.”

This paragraph explains the importance of conducting frequent inspections to avoid catastrophic incidents. This claim is supported by research cited in the next paragraph; companies subject to inspections showed a 9.4 percent decrease in injury rates compared to uninspected ones. Companies subjected to inspections — that comply with OSHA’s standards — do not have to pay added costs.

3. “During the first three years under Trump, OSHA conducted about 81,000 safety inspections — a 4.7 percent decrease from about 85,000 conducted during the last three years of Obama’s presidency, according to a Public Integrity analysis of the agency’s inspection data.”

I chose this paragraph because it clearly demonstrates original data analysis in that it compares data on OSHA inspections between Trump’s first three years as president to Obama’s last three. After obtaining each set of data, the reporter calculated percent decrease, which shows how much workplace inspections have declined since our past president. This is important to the story because it supports a key part of the story’s message: that workplace inspections have declined, and, as a result, cost lives.

4. “In 2019, OSHA’s safety inspectors conducted 962 investigations into fatal or catastrophic workplace incidents — the highest number since the agency began publishing the data in 2011.”

This paragraph shows how most investigations published occurred in 2019 through data analysis. It shows the exact number of investigations that occurred as a total in 2019 and compared it to the total number of investigations in each year since 2011. Additionally, it shows the importance of OSHA’s responsibilities and shares the concern for the growing number of investigations that are taking place.

5. “But Congress hasn’t cut OSHA’s enforcement budget; instead, it has given the agency slightly more funding than the administration has asked for. It earmarked $576.8 million for the fiscal year 2020 — $19.3 million more than requested.”

This paragraph is important because it shows that budgetary issues weren’t to blame for OSHA’s decreasing inspections. They didn’t have the resources/staff to conduct as many inspections–agency personnel is at an all-time low–yet they had the money to get the resources, but didn’t. This paragraph shows that there’s a much larger administrative issue at hand.

The story of Justin Harrington seems to have been chosen both because of its parallels to Knowles’ story, and because it is a prime example of an inspection done on a company only after someone had died, a pattern that was found through Public Integrity’s data analysis.

## Group 2

As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted. City police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014; last year (2018), the rate was just 27 percent, a 14 percentage point drop.

Of 50 of the nation’s largest cities, Baltimore is one of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis. In Chicago, the homicide arrest rate has dropped 21 percentage points, in Boston it has dropped 12 points and in St. Louis it is down 9.

Baltimore is also one of 30 cities that have seen an increase in homicides in recent years, with the greatest raw number increase in killings of any city other than Chicago, which has four times the population. While homicide rates remain near historical lows in most American cities, Baltimore and Chicago are now both seeing murder tallies that rival the early 2000s.

While there is evidence for and against a nationwide Ferguson effect — the theory that crime increased after 2014 as police faced more scrutiny following the shooting of Michael Brown in Ferguson, Mo. — in Baltimore there is an indisputable Freddie Gray effect. As violence in the city has risen since 2015, the likelihood of a killer being arrested has dropped precipitously.

1. As Baltimore has seen a stunning surge of violence, with nearly a killing each day for the past three years in a city of 600,000, homicide arrests have plummeted. City police made an arrest in 41 percent of homicides in 2014; last year (2018), the rate was just 27 percent, a 14 percentage point drop.

This paragraph seems to compare two different time periods followed by a rate over the year.  It looks like they went through the data and did a count of death per day, and compared that with the homicide rate which was decreasing along with the number of arrests. They likely used some of the functions we used in class, including grouping and sorting as well as time element (years) and change in percentages.

2. Of 50 of the nation’s largest cities, Baltimore is one of 34 where police now make homicide arrests less often than in 2014, according to a Washington Post analysis. In Chicago, the homicide arrest rate has dropped 21 percentage points, in Boston it has dropped 12 points and in St. Louis it is down 9.

In this paragraph, the reporters are taking the number of homicide cases, and looking at how many arrests were made in 2014. From there, the Post analyzed and compared the percentages over time. This data seems to compare that arrest rates across different cities and compare the rate at which the percentages have dropped. The variables here are the cities, the homicide arrest, the months in the year (2014).

3. Baltimore is also one of 30 cities that have seen an increase in homicides in recent years, with the greatest raw number increase in killings of any city other than Chicago, which has four times the population. While homicide rates remain near historical lows in most American cities, Baltimore and Chicago are now both seeing murder tallies that rival the early 2000s.

In this one, it looks like the reporters sorted and grouped the data for Baltimore and Chicago. They looked across 30 cities, for which they factored in population and the greatest raw increase of killings. We think maybe they looked at murder per capita, and then sorted from lowest to highest. This is important to the story because it shows up the impact of the killing and brings newsworthiness to this piece. Baltimore becomes a character in the story, driven by the data and likely its proximity to Washington. The data leads the reporters to focus on the city, then find a mother who can tell her personal story.

4. For most of the decade before 2015, Baltimore’s annual homicide arrest rate hovered at about 40 percent. Since 2015, the arrest rate hasn’t topped 30 percent in any year. And while most cities saw their arrest rates drop gradually, Baltimore’s decline was sudden — plummeting 15 percentage points in 2015, after Gray’s death, the largest single-year drop for any city already solving less than half its homicides.

This is an annual arrest rate comparison for Baltimore in different years. What is not clear from the data – and would require more reporting – is why the arrest rates went down. Some reasons that might have been: a decrease in staff, lack of effort after Freddie Gray’s death, or a change in caseload per detective. The percent change seems sudden. Of the 1,002 homicides between 2015 and the beginning of 2018, just 252 — one out of every four — resulted in an arrest. That seems worth exploring more.

5. Homicides have soared in several neighborhoods since Gray’s death. Sandtown-Winchester, where Gray died, has seen 22 more homicides in the three-year period since Gray’s death than it did in the three years before he died. Southwest Baltimore saw its homicides rise by 35, and Greater Rosemont has seen 26 more since 2015. In each of those neighborhoods, police make an arrest in fewer than 25 percent of cases, including 16 percent in Sandtown-Winchester.

We think this was created through data analysis because the reporters isolated neighborhoods, grouped and sorted them by number of homicides and arrests. It would be similar to the manner in which the Howard Center reporters used data for the heat story. The difference percentages shows the changes over the year and that is information that allows us to compare and really know how grave the issue is. We did wonder how the Post chose these neighborhoods – ZIP codes seemed too large.


## Group 3

“Since The Washington Post began tracking fatal shootings by police in 2015, officers have fatally shot 247 women out of the more than 5,600 people killed overall.”

“Since 2015, Black women have accounted for less than 1 percent of the overall fatal shootings in cases where race was known. But within this small subset, Black women, who are 13 percent of the female population, account for 20 percent of the women shot and killed and 28 percent of the unarmed deaths.”

 “The starkest difference between women and men is the rate: Women account for about half the population, but 4 percent of the killings.”

 “Crenshaw said Black women’s deaths also may be dismissed as “collateral damage” if they are killed while police are pursuing someone else. Twenty of the 247 women were killed in that kind of situation, analysis shows. In 12 of those 20 shootings, police said the women killed were caught in crossfire or shot accidentally.”

This story focuses on statistics and stories about women who, like Breonna Taylor, were fatally shot by police in the last five years.

We know that the statistics we selected derive from original data analysis because The Washington Post has been tracking fatal police shootings since 2015.


Key Sentences:

1. “Since The Washington Post began tracking fatal shootings by police in 2015, officers have fatally shot 247 women out of the more than 5,600 people killed overall.”

The first sentence, while based on a simple analysis — isolating one demographic (gender) and adding all of the isolated data points together  — forms the foundation for the rest of the story. The other findings drill deeper into the 247 cases.

2. “Since 2015, Black women have accounted for less than 1 percent of the overall fatal shootings in cases where race was known. But within this small subset, Black women, who are 13 percent of the female population, account for 20 percent of the women shot and killed and 28 percent of the unarmed deaths.”

In the second finding, for example, The Post uses their database and population data to show the discrepancy between the proportion of female deaths that Black women make up and the lower proportion of the female population they comprise.  

3. “Crenshaw said Black women’s deaths also may be dismissed as “collateral damage” if they are killed while police are pursuing someone else. Twenty of the 247 women were killed in that kind of situation, analysis shows. In 12 of those 20 shootings, police said the women killed were caught in crossfire or shot accidentally.”

The third finding highlights cases like Taylor’s, in which women are killed as bystanders during police action. The statistic leads into reporting on two other women, Alteria Woods and India Kager, whose deaths did not get as much attention.

4. “The starkest difference between women and men is the rate: Women account for about half the population, but 4 percent of the killings.”

Although the story focuses on deaths of women, the fourth sentence highlights the gender gap in fatal police shootings (men are killed much more frequently) and ties it into the stereotypical notion that women are seen as less threatening in comparison to a man.

5. “Of the 89 women killed at residences where they lived or often stayed, 12 encounters began as did Taylor’s — with a warrant to conduct a search or make an arrest in an investigation.”

The fifth sentence again isolates a subset of the data and compares it to Taylor’s shooting. This finding was used to identify additional “characters” to highlight, including Geraldine Townsend and Rhogena Nicholas.

## Group 4

Why did they focus on Christopher McCormack. Do the necessary data analysis to justify that decision. Why does he stand out as newsworthy, from all of the people they could have selected.

The allegations against McCormack read in some ways like those against many other cops in the NYPD: that he was destructive in searching a home or overly physical with someone on the street. What stands out, though, is how often Black and Latino men accused him of invasive, humiliating searches.

Of at least 77 allegations made against him [McCormack] in 26 separate CCRB complaints, 29 were unsubstantiated; five were “unfounded,” meaning investigators concluded the incident never took place; and 27 were “exonerated,” meaning the conduct fell within patrol guidelines.

Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.

1. Eighty-six of the roughly 420 officers in the department who currently hold a rank above captain — running precincts and other large commands and overseeing hundreds of officers — have tallied at least one misconduct allegation that was substantiated by the CCRB, meaning that investigators amassed enough evidence of offenses, ranging from bad language to pistol whippings, to say that they happened and broke patrol guidelines. The most common involved improper property entries and searches.

2. Over the years, a profound consequence of the NYPD’s expansion of stop-and-frisk became clear. Most of those stopped were young and Black; almost all had been acting lawfully (Links to an external site.), walking away without an arrest or summons.

3. For men who lived in high-crime neighborhoods, always communities of color, the dragnet descended and never let up. Even as crime began to decline, ultimately falling to some of the lowest levels in the city’s modern history, many of those neighborhoods endured an exponential surge in the practice of stopping and questioning people deemed suspicious.

4. To make arrests, McCormack expected officers in his command to make use of their stop-and-frisk authority. Stops tripled in the 40th Precinct for the first six months of his tenure, according to police data. To help understand McCormack’s effect on crime, ProPublica analyzed data that experts consider a bellwether for a violent precinct like the 4-0: murders, rapes and robberies. In the roughly two years that McCormack led the precinct, murders fell, rapes remained about the same and robberies increased.

5. McCormack has been accused of misconduct in at least 16 lawsuits, 11 of which settled for a combined $415,000. The allegations ranged from racial discrimination to strip-searches to false arrests.  The city settled three of them in 2016, paying a total of $84,500 to complainants who alleged that McCormack had been involved in improper strip-searches.


The article is centered on the unjust nature of stop-and-frisk and the amassing of allegations against an officer in the NYPD. The first statistic demonstrates the fact that Assistant Chief Christopher McCormack of the NYPD is not unique: that there is a culture of misconduct within the department that has gone unchecked for many years.

The second statistic highlights that the victims of this system are young black and latinx individuals who are specifically targeted. Even when crime levels are adjusted, the third statistic shows that the stop-and-frisking increased. From here, the fourth statistic zooms in on McCormack’s precinct where stops tripled in his first six months.

The last statistic shows the broader scope of McCormack’s lone misconduct by detailing the financial implications of lawsuits brought against him. The number of lawsuits and the large sum demonstrate the gravity of the damage he did, but it also creates a problem for the city, having to cover his costs with taxpayer money. The statistic suggests that, not only did the city allow him to continue to assault their citizens, but they used the citizen’s money to take care of McCormack.

Overall, the article uses McCormack to illustrate the toxic nature of the NYPD and that police force to showcase the corruption of the law enforcement system as a whole, all the while using statistics to back up their claims. ProPublica aggregated a total of 12,056 closed complaints spanning from 1985 to January 2020 against every active-duty police officer of the NYPD to compile the data for this article.

## Group 5

[Valentina D’Alessandro] was one of at least 179 people who have died in Los Angeles County since 2000 in accidents where street racing was suspected, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of coroner’s records, police reports and media accounts from 2000 to 2017.

The deadliest year on record was 2007, with 18 fatal crashes. After a period with relatively few recorded deaths, the count grew in recent years, with 15 fatalities in 2015, 11 in 2016 and 12 deaths in 2017, the Times analysis shows.

The dead were overwhelmingly male and young: More than half were 21 or younger, including two children, ages 4 and 8, killed along with their mother. Slightly less than half of the victims— 47% — were behind the wheel. The rest were either passengers in the speeding vehicles, spectators or people simply walking on a sidewalk or driving home.

Deaths have occurred all across L.A. County, with the biggest concentration in the small city of Commerce. Eleven have died on the small, industrial city’s streets since 2000.

1. “The dead were overwhelmingly male and young: More than half were 21 or younger, including two children, ages 4 and 8, killed along with their mother. Slightly less than half of the victims— 47% — were behind the wheel. The rest were either passengers in the speeding vehicles, spectators or people simply walking on a sidewalk or driving home.”

This paragraph was chosen because it must have been the product of data analysis and details the main demographics of people who are either involved in the deadly act of street racing or victimized by it. As indicated by the graph, the drivers themselves often turn into victims in these tragedies. Characters who are loved ones or family members of these victims are highlighted throughout the story, which is likely the result of analyzing raw data of individual crashes.

2. “One of the few law enforcement agencies tracking street racing incidents is the CHP, and it has only been doing so since 2016. From July 2016 to July 2017, the CHP has recorded nearly 700 racing incidents in L.A. County. Those races involved roughly 17,000 vehicles and 22,000 people, according to the CHP data. The data did not include fatalities.”

The Times used data from the CHP to show that street races put 22,000 lives at risk. This paragraph includes an agency for which The Times obtained data from and the importance of law enforcement’s attention towards tracking street races. The Times highlights that few law enforcement agencies are tracking street race fatalities and to do so is an ongoing challenge. It was necessary for the Times to mostly use original reports for the story since most agencies do not have any available data.

3. “The deadliest year on record was 2007, with 18 fatal crashes. After a period with relatively few recorded deaths, the count grew in recent years, with 15 fatalities in 2015, 11 in 2016 and 12 deaths in 2017, the Times analysis shows.”

This paragraph was chosen because it shows that data analysis that the Times did on the fatal crashes that happened over an extended amount of time. Data like this is essential to the story because it adds to other background and character information that is displayed throughout the story such as background stories of people that have died, why the racing is dangerous, and how it has impacted the city. This information was created throughout data analysis because the Times were able to analyze the change over time.

4. “She was one of at least 179 people who have died in Los Angeles County since 2000 in accidents where street racing was suspected, according to a Los Angeles Times analysis of coroner’s records, police reports and media accounts from 2000 to 2017.”

We chose this paragraph because it sets the scene for the entire story, giving readers a broad-stroke picture of the occurrence that will be investigated and picked apart through the rest of the story. It puts in context the article’s opening story about a 16-year-old girl who, by chance, ended up dying in a streetrace: she is not the only one. The article later  mentions that 179 — no small number — is a conservative estimate due to the difficult nature of determining street-racing related auto accidents. The LA Times states that the number is a product of analysis, one it garnered by analyzing coroner’s records, police reports and media accounts from 2000 to 2017. While I’m not certain exactly how the LA times derived their conclusions, I have a hunch that they filtered each set of records for different keywords or characteristics and then cross-referenced them.

5. “The Times’ analysis found that at least 60 people died in crashes related to street racing in the city of Los Angeles between 2000 and 2017. Only two other cities in the county — Long Beach and Commerce — saw more than 10 deaths during that period.”

This paragraph is especially telling because it provides a stark contrast to the narrative of the story, that being that street racing is an urgent and deadly issue. However, this contrast is being made to highlight the lack of documentation related to this epidemic. There are definitely more than 60 deaths related to car crashes. But without the proper data, it is impossible to know the real toll, as well as the strategies that may help quell it from recurring. Even so, the little information available was able to display the fact that street racing is a pressing matter in not just Los Angeles, but the rest of California as well.
