# Data Acquisition Project

This project will give you some real-world experience in trying to get a useful dataset from a government agency – or trying to pry it out of the hands of its keepers, which may turn out to be a more appropriate description of the effort in some cases.

## Why we're seeking data

You’re helping us obtain data that will power an investigative reporting project being done by students at the University of Maryland Philip Merrill College of Journalism (working for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism at the college).  Your participation is critical to this project’s success!  

The project is examining evictions by public housing authorities in cities across the country.  Public housing -- government subsidized housing -- is often housing of last resort for low-income people, the thing standing between them and homelessness.  In some cities, we have found, public housing authorities, the agencies charged with housing low-income people, are surprisingly active evictors, and often evicting over small amounts of money.     

By participating in this effort, we hope you will learn a great deal about how to figure out whether a government agency has data, and how to successfully negotiate for access.  This skill is one of the most valuable things a journalist can learn to do.

## The data we're seeking

You will be assigned a public housing authority from which to request data and other records.  If possible, we'd like the last five years worth of data.     

* A spreadsheet or other database that contains detailed information about individual evictions, including but not limited to date of initiation, reason, amount of back rent due, amount of fees owed, address, tenant name, age, race, occupants and outcome.
* A spreadsheet or other database that contains detailed information about billings, payments for legal fees and court costs
* Electronic copies of court filings related to evictions
* Aggregated annual statistics on evictions
* Aggregated annual statistics on eviction-related costs and expenditures
* A list of buildings owned or operated by the authority with the number of units and unit addresses
* The authority’s policies and procedures for evictions (or a link to them, if they are available online)

## Grading and Deadlines

This project is worth 10 percent of your total final grade.

Your grade does not depend on whether you successfully get the data we are requesting, though certainly I hope that happens.  

Your grade does depend on whether you display a solid, steady, and intelligent effort that takes advantage of your journalistic skills, your knowledge of the law and the application of the approaches we discuss in class.  Your will demonstrate to me that you are making that effort by clearly and concisely discussing your successes and failures in the milestone memos you submit for review.

The grading breaks down this way.

* Interim status updates - 40 percent total
  * Week 4 update (Milestone 1) - 20 percent
    * Detail your reporting efforts over the last two weeks to learn as much as you can about whether or not the agency has the records we are seeking.  Among the questions you should answer: Who have you talked to?  What have they told you about the records we are seeking? Which ones do they keep?  Are they in an electronic format? By what specific names does the agency refer to the records?  If all the information is stored in a central database, what is it called?  Are they willing to give us some or all of the records without submitting a public records request? Also submit a link to your contact log.
  * Week 6 update (Milestone 2) - 20 percent
    * Provide a brief update on the status of your negotiations with the agency for these records, in approximately 100 words. If a public information act request will be required to obtain the records, write up a sample request that incorporates information you have uncovered during your reporting (i.e. the names of specific databases). Also submit a link to your contact log.  
* Week 8 Final memo (Milestone 3) - 50 percent
    * In a memo of approximately 1000 words, you will describe your efforts in detail to obtain the requested data from your agency. You should cover the following points.
      * About the reporting: who did you talk to and what did you learn in your efforts to gather as much information as possible about the data before submitting a request? How did this help you formulate a better request?
      * About the law: How did your use of the law factor into your efforts to obtain the data?  What legal points did the agency raise?  What legal points did you raise?
      * About the negotiation: Tell us about your contacts with the agency. Did officials put up barriers to access or accommodate you? Did they object to releasing the data in electronic form? What was the outcome?
      * Looking ahead: If you have not obtained the data, what steps are you planning to take next?  Have you followed up recently with your agency? What have they told you?
      * Lessons learned: What did you learn from this project that you might be able to apply to future reporting efforts and that would be useful for other students to know?  Did you learn anything about yourself? Your insights here are an important feature of the assignment.
* Week 10 Presentation (Lightning Talk) - 10 percent
     * In week 10, you will update the class verbally on two things in a presentation with a hard cap of three minutes:
      * Where your data request stands.  Have you obtained the data? If not, why?
      * Tell us a brief story about a single part of the data acquisition process, and the lesson you learned from it that you think is worth sharing from the class.  


## Contact log

You will maintain a written log of your contacts as a Google spreadsheet.  This is an essential and vitally important part of this project. This log, which you will submit as part of your graded work on this assignment along with your final report, should include the following for each occasion that you reach or even attempt to reach someone for this project:  

* the person’s full name;
* their job title;
* the agency for which they works;
* the location of that agency;
* at least enough contact information so that you can find this person again later or so that someone else reading the log could find this person again (phone number, e-mail address or both);
* the date and time;
* and a brief summary of what transpired.  

Some of the people you deal with – say, the receptionists or assistants who first answer the phone – may not want to give you their names, but you can always try telling them that you like to keep a record of the people with whom you speak. Your thoroughness may be appreciated.  An inadequate log – especially one that does not provide enough information for someone reading the log to know precisely whom you contacted, how you contacted them, when you contacted them and what you discussed – may prevent you from getting a passing grade for this assignment.

## Request Letter

Do not send an official PIA request letter without getting it approved by me in advance.  When it's ready, I'll give you Howard Center letterhead to put it on for sending.

In most cases, you'll need to draft a public information act request letter to get the data, based on the laws of that state.  In order to draft a good request letter with a high chance of getting filled, you'll need to do a lot of reporting to learn if the data you seek exists, who keeps the data (the custodian), what it's called and what's in it, what might be exempt from disclosure and other information.  

You'll also need to familiarize with the law in the state and write a letter based on public records laws in the state.

When you do request the database, you will ask for a waiver of fees in any written request for the database. You will need to negotiate over this issue if the agency proposes to charge you for the data, and we will talk in class about how to do that. You are not required or expected to pay for this database yourself.

## Key things to keep in mind

Three key things to keep in mind:

* In talking with agencies, you should always identify yourself as a reporter for the Howard Center for Investigative Journalism, a non-profit investigative reporting unit based in Maryland.  If someone asks if you're a student, please say yes, but don't volunteer that you're a student or that this is for a class.  We are seeking information that could be used in a news story.
* Explain that you're working on a national project on evictions and are submitting public records requests to public housing authorities that manage and operate public housing. Confirm that they do. Some smaller housing authorities don’t have their own housing and provide housing assistance through other programs, such as Section 8. We’re only interested in those that manage their own public housing. So if you’ve been assigned an PHA that doesn’t have public housing, contact Sean right away, so he can give you another one. I've confirmed most of these places do have public housing.
* This is a reporting project. You may need to do web research to identify the correct agencies to contact, and the people in those agencies to contact. But it will take a lot more than web research.  You will need to call people and email them to identify who keeps the data, what it's called, what's in it, and attempt to coax it out of them -- either with a public records request or without one. And you will need to be politely persistent in dealing with them.  If you tell me you sent someone an email and didn't hear back for two weeks and didn't follow up with several phone calls, that is inadequate.  
* When requesting data for this project, you shouldn’t immediately volunteer why you’re requesting data or share details of the project.  But during negotiations for access to data, you may find it necessary to share some details, and that’s okay.  


## Housing authority assignments

We're going to be requesting data from the 20 largest cities in the U.S. You have been assigned a specific housing authority, in a specific city.  Please note that some cities have more than one housing authority, so be sure to stick to the one I've assigned.

You can find your [random assignments in this spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1vlwv9BxF_MWiedgu_bjmS49ubAyEurtheUvtTzrzyPU).
