## About this workbook

As you watch the video, follow along with me in this file, running pre-written code as I instruct. When you see **Task**, that's a signal you need to write some code of your own.

## About R markdown 

This is an R Markdown document, which we'll be using to create data notebooks this semester that combine text and code. We'll use it to load, clean, analyze and visualize data.  And, eventually, we'll use these files to produce a publishable webpage. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.  

## Text 

Above, "About R Markdown" is an example of a text header.  The sentence that begins "This is an R Markdown document..." is an example of a text sentence.  We use text to write up findings and put findings in context.  The text we write doesn't affect the code we write in the documents. 

## Codeblocks

We'll write code inside of "codeblocks", special sections of the document that are set up to execute code. Here's an empty codeblock.

```{r}

```

And here's a codeblock that contains one very simple line of code, a function that prints out my name. Run it now, using the methods described in the video. The code executes below the codeblock, and in the console below.   

```{r}

print("Sean Mussenden")

```

We can include text inside of codeblocks, as comments to explain what our code is doing line by line.  When we use the correct format for comments -- starts with a # -- R knows to ignore them.

```{r}
# This function prints out my name
print("Sean Mussenden")

```

If we don't include the hashtag, R attempts to execute it. It throws an error. Get used to seeing errors this semester.  Even advanced data journalists run into them all the time.  

```{r}

This function prints out my name
print("Sean Mussenden")

```

**Task**: In the empty codeblock below, write the function to print out your own name and run it.  Include a comment inside the codeblock that explains what you're doing. If you get an error, compare your code to my code on line 38. 

```{r}

```

## Load data 

We're going to load a very simple data set, so that we can review ways

```{r}

object <- 


```




## Examine Data

## How this lab works

You should read the text on this web page and watch the embedded videos, and follow the instructions I give as you go along.  It's very important to watch the videos, because, in addition to showing you how to do things step-by-step, the audio track also contains some key contextual information to help make sense of what you're seeing.     
## Objectives 

### Objective 01_a: Install on your local machine the necessary software tools for this course.

To complete this objective, you'll need to install on your machine the necessary software tools for this course. 

They are:

  * R, the programming language we'll be using to do data programming in this course. [Download link](https://cloud.r-project.org/)
  * R Studio, the software tool we'll be using to write R code and load, clean and analyze data. [Download link](https://rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/#download)
  * GitHub Desktop, a software tool we'll be using to transfer code to our local machine to the GitHub.com website. [Download link](https://desktop.github.com/)

In the video below, I show you step-by-step how to do that, while offering some thoughts on what each thing does.  

Before moving on to the next objective, please watch the video in full and complete the objective by successfully installing the three items named above.      

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNzZ1PfUDNk")

```

### Objective 01_b: Set up a GitHub repository for classwork 

To complete this objective, you'll need to: 
  * Create an account on GitHub.com, a code repository website where we'll be storing much of the work you do in this class.  
  * Create a private repository on GitHub.com specifically for this class and give me permission to access it. 
  * Use GitHub Desktop to pull your class repository to your local machine, a process called "cloning".  
  
In the video below, I show you step-by-step how to do that, while explaining what you need to know about GitHub, as we'll use it in this class. 

Before moving on to the next objective, please watch the video in full and complete the objective by successfully doing the three objectives above.      

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNzZ1PfUDNk")
```

### Objective 01_c: Develop an understanding of how we'll use RStudio

To complete this objective, you'll need to:
  * Watch me tour the RStudio workspace.
  * Load a sample RMarkdown file, a file format designed for "data notebooks" that we'll use all semester. 
  * Make some minor edits to the sample RMarkdown file and run some very basic code. [Download link for the file]("https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNzZ1PfUDNk")
  
In the video below, I show you step-by-step how to do that, while explaining some fundamentals about R, RStudio and RMarkdown. 

Before moving on to the next objective, please watch the video in full and complete the objective by successfully doing the three objectives above.      

### Objective 01_d: Develop an understanding of how to submit changes to GitHub, and submit to ELMS

To complete this objective, you'll need to:
  * Save changes you've made to the RMarkdown file
  * Upload those changes from your local machine to your code repository on GitHub.com.
  * Submit your lab assignment on ELMS by sending the link to your GitHub.com repository. 
  
In the video below, I show you step-by-step how to do that, while explaining some fundamentals about GitHub

```{r echo=FALSE}
knitr::include_url("https://www.youtube.com/embed/zNzZ1PfUDNk")
```

## Lab complete

If you have successfully submitted the link to the edited RMarkdown file in your repository on GitHub.com to the ELMS assignment for this lab, you are done!
