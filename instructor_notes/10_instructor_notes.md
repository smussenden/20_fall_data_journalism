As part of a new investigative series, the Center for Public Integrity and Stateline have published a dataset of polling places during the 2012–18 US general elections for 30 states (and plan to add more states “in the coming weeks”). To assemble the dataset, reporters filed 1,200 records requests, and then converted the disparate files they received into standardized CSVs listing each polling place’s county, precinct, name, and address.

On Friday, the Washington Post released several datasets and computer scripts from its Pulitzer Prize–winning series, “2°C: Beyond the Limit,” which examined how “extreme climate change has arrived in America.” The data files — derived from NOAA’s nClimDiv and nClimGrid climate datasets — contain the annual average temperatures and seasonal temperature changes for each state and county in the contiguous US.

For several years, the Southern Poverty Law Center’s “Whose Heritage?” project has been gathering and mapping information on “public symbols of the Confederacy,” such as monuments, place names, official holidays, commemorative license plates, and municipal seals. For each of the 1,800+ entries, the project’s dataset indicates the type of monument/symbol, its location, sponsor, year dedicated, and (if applicable) year removed.

New York City’s Department of Sanitation publishes a dataset of the monthly tonnage it collects from city residences, going back to 1990. For each community district and month, the dataset tallies the weight of household trash, recyclables, “organics,” and more — including, for each January, the tonnage of Christmas trees collected. Related: Reporters at The City recently analyzed the dataset, and found potential evidence of Manhattanites fleeing the city in March. They also interviewed the Department of Sanitation’s anthropologist-in-residence.	"https://data.cityofnewyork.us/City-Government/DSNY-Monthly-Tonnage-Data/ebb7-mvp5

The Foreign Service Act of 1980 requires US presidents to provide Congress a “report on the demonstrated competence” for each ambassadorial nominee. In 2014, the government began disclosing these records, which had long been held secret. But the government’s policy applied only to new nominees. Law professor Ryan Scoville, however, used the Freedom of Information Act to pry loose the rest — more than three decades of concise biographies — and, earlier this year, put them online, accompanied by a dataset that describes the nominees’ qualifications and political contributions. Related: “Unqualified Ambassadors,” Scoville’s Duke Law Journal article on the topic, and his summary in Lawfare. [h/t u/smurfyjenkins]	"https://www.state.gov/resources-bureau-of-human-resources/
