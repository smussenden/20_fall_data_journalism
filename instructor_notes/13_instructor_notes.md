Intros
* 10 minutes
* Today, we're working on final project.  I'm going to come around and talk with each of you about how it's going, problem solve, talk about next steps.
* I saw some really good progress in your last deliverable.  
* For the next deliverable, which is due Sunday, it's going to be something similar, but I'll be grading you on progress made from the previous deliverable.
* For the next deliverable.
  * Last deliverable was more about exploration, getting a sense of the data, testing ideas.
  * This deliverable is about honing in on a specific storyline.
  * For example: group 4 seems to have a promising story about schools named after confederate leaders.
  * We're working toward being able to use data analysis to write a factual sentence that will serve as the foundation of our reporting, and several supporting sentences to put that in proper context.
* I'm also going to be setting up times to meet with you as a group if you want.
  * Wed between 2 and 4
  * Wed between 5 and 7
  * Thursday between noon and 2
  * Thursday between 6 and 7
  * Friday between 3 and 5.

Group 5
* I have a good sense of the shape of the data.  
* Good exploratory analysis, but struggling to see what the story line is.  What is the most promising thing you've found here so far.  

Group 2
* Interesting story you've found on California.
* What is the sentence you think you have.
* Has more than any other non-union state. Had some monuments dedicated in the fucking 40s!
* Three trees at national parks that inidicate the challenge of getting them renamed.
* Role of daughters of confederacy -- for context, you could look at all of the monuments they put up.
